##FizzBuzz

The exercise is complete when the following input:

    [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30]

Results in the following output:

    "1, 2, Fizz, Buzz, Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz"

Things to keep in mind:
    
    - Donâ€™t write any production code before you have a failing test (including compile errors!)
    - Make each step as small and simple as possible.
    - Implementation
